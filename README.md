# Nodedock

Docker NodeJS development environment.

## Goal

I'm an ex-PHP developer, and I've used to use Laradock and similar solutions a lot. However, there's no close thing in NodeJS ecosystem (or at least I didn't find it). So, I decided to build a solution based on Laradock, but for NodeJS. This is how Nodedock was born.

## Based on Laradock

This project is based on awesome [Laradock](https://github.com/laradock/laradock), [contributors](https://github.com/laradock/laradock/graphs/contributors)
